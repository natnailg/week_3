types script
- it is a superset of javascript that adds a type system. 
- in java or c we have to declare variables a specific type. 
- in js we use let or const when declaring without specifing what type it will return 
type is not natively by itself, you have tranpile it into vanilla javascript before we can tun in a browser or a node, wehere ever the runtim is.
